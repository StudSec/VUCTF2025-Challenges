Chaos reigns as rogue robotic vacuums hijack all electronic devices at the VU. Amid the panic, a crumpled note referencing a strange file was vacuumed away, hinting only: /home/vuctf/studsec/vuctf_2025/base64_secure_flag_v1.txt. With the control terminal air-gapped and traditional methods blocked, your only chance lies with a DigiSpark USB device and just 30 seconds after insertion. Will you manage to infiltrate in time and uncover the secret the Roomba tried so desperately to hide?

Ask one of the Crew members to guide you to the hardware setup. You could test your solution there.
