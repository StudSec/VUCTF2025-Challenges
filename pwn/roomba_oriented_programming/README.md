## Roomba Oriented Programming 
it's a straightforward BoF players need to build a ROP chain using the gadgets available in the core dump. The idea is to:
- Use a read syscall to write /bin/sh into .bss.
- Execute an execve("/bin/sh", NULL, NULL) syscall using ROP gadgets.

The twist: exploitation must be done blindly against a remote server where the binary is running. The difficulty lies in analyzing the core dump to recover useful gadgets and offsets, since the ELF isnâ€™t provided.
